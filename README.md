# Artificial Neural Networks - Keras Neural Nets

One of the deepest traditions in learning about deep learning is to first tackle the exciting problem of MNIST classification. The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a first test for new classification algorithms. 

We follow this tradition to investigate the performance of artificial neural networks of different complexity on MNIST. However, since MNIST is too easy for accessing the full power of modern machine learning algorithms we will extend our analysis to the recently introduced, harder Fashion-MNIST dataset.
